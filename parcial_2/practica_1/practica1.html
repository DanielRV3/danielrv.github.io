        <div class="estrofa">
            In the skies above the isle<br>
            Aces in exile prevail!
        </div>
        <div class="estrofa">
            From near and far they arrived, joined the force <br>
            Ready to serve the Allied command <br>
            Sent into training, though they already earned their wings <br>
            They were ready to fly, they were fit for the fight
        </div>
        <div class="estrofa">
            Once in the air, the battle begins <br>
            They've proven their worth, now they fly for revenge
        </div>

        <div class="estribillo">
            Fighter pilots in exile fly over foreign land <br>
            To the story be heard, tell of 303rd <br>
            Fighter pilots of Poland in the battle of Britain <br>
            Guarding the skies of the isle
        </div>

        <div class="estrofa">
            Even at night, shadows cover the ground <br>
            And the fighting goes on from dusk 'til dawn <br>
            With the claw of the Reich, with the claw of the eagle <br>
            They were ready to fly, they were ready to die
        </div>
        <div class="estrofa">
            Up in the air, the battle goes on <br>
            They've proven their worth, now they have their revenge
        </div>
        <div class="estribillo">
            Fighter pilots in exile fly over foreign land <br>
            Tell their story again, tell of 310 <br>
            Men from Czechoslovakia in the Battle of Britain <br>
            Guarding the skies of the isle
        </div>
        <div class="estrofa">
            Over the battlefield, brave men long way from home <br>
            Few are the chosen ones sent to the sky to die <br>
            Over the battlefield, brave men long way from home <br>
            Few are the chosen ones sent to the sky to die
        </div>
        <div class="estrofa">
            Oh fly, it echoes in history <br>
            Turning the tide in the heavens above
        </div>
        <div class="estribillo">
            Fighter pilots in exile fly over foreign land <br>
            When the battle has been won, tell of 401 <br>
            Fighter pilots of Canada in the battle of Britain <br>
            Guarding the skies of the isle
        </div>
        <div class="estrofa">
            On wings of history they turn from home <br>
            To live eternally, skybound they roam <br>
            In all of history, never before <br>
            Was more owed to so few
        </div>
        <div class="estribillo">
            Fighter pilots in exile!
